# Task-2-Customer-Segmentation
This project is part of my Machine Learning internship at Prodigy Infotech.  It involves applying K-Means Clustering to segment retail customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using a real-world dataset.  The main goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses target marketing strategies more effectively.
